# TRELLO_API


A Trello board is a list of lists, filled with cards, used by you and your team. It's a lot more than that, though. Trello has everything you need to organize projects of any size. Open a card and you can add comments, upload file attachments, create checklists, add labels and due dates, and more. https://trello.com/en/tour
This project is include python code to exrtract API data from TRELLO web application from nested resource link.

You have to create user for extract token number and secret number for trello. All the codes are using python3 on Jupyter Notebooks. I use Windows 10 for OS
